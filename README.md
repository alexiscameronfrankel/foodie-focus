A timer built with React.js to help you focus! Traditionally, the Pomodoro method functions where you work for 25 minutes and then and take breaks whose length of time depends on how many work sessions you have done (feel free to adjust to your own time, though). During your break you are provided some jokes and also podcasts curated to the kind of break you are one (short and long) as well as your interest. 

I hope this timer helps you focus, as it has with me!
